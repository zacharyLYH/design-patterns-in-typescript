# Design Patterns in Typescript (WIP)

> ‚úÖ 8 / 14

## Software Prerequisites

‚ö†Ô∏è NodeJS >=12.20
‚ö†Ô∏è TypeScript ^5.5.0

## Knowledge Prerequisites

- Basic OOP concepts.
- Basic Typescipt / Intermediate programming knowledge.

### Why does this exist? What is it for?

What better way to learn challenging programming concepts than to program it hands on! As a self-learner, this repository is mainly for contributors that want to practice design patterns and Typescript all in one place. For the uninitiated, this might be a good starting point to learning a few patterns through good examples and a well organized library of design patterns.

### Usage

> **All code, discussion, and explanations may or may not be 100% accurate. Should any errors show up, feel free to start an issue.**

1. Every folder is aptly named by its design pattern. Pick your poison.
2. In every pattern, there will be _at least_ 1 working example and a README document with the following sections:
    - Overview of the pattern.
    - A description for each working example, and how the pattern applies.
3. Run `tsc`. This transpiles **all** the Typescript code in the directory to Javascript. Then run `node <file-name>.js` to execute your code.

### Contribute

1. While the title still says **(WIP)**, all patterns will be implemented in the order as laid out in the [Head First Design Patterns text](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented/dp/149207800X/ref=asc_df_149207800X/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=459709175715&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4047598088864205723&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9005533&hvtargid=pla-918195320150&psc=1). Expected frequency is one pattern every 2-4 days. Ultimately, the original contributors will decide the pace.
2. Fork this repository.
3. Each pattern will be _developed in its own branch_, named after the name of the pattern. Let the original contributors decide when the right time is for a new pattern.
4. Approved contributions (new code or otherwise) will be merged after review.
5. Every new working example should go into its own folder.

> We strive to follow **good general coding practices**, **good typescript practices**, and **a good use of GitHub and version controlling**.

> During (WIP), our aim is to complete all 14/14 patterns described in the Head First text. Once that minimum bar is met, the other patterns unmentioned in the text may be added at your pace.
