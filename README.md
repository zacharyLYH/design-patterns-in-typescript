# Design Patterns in Typescrip

## Software Prerequisites

‚ö†Ô∏è NodeJS >=12.20
‚ö†Ô∏è TypeScript ^5.5.0

## Knowledge Prerequisites

-   Basic OOP concepts.
-   Basic Typescipt / Intermediate programming knowledge.

### Why does this exist? What is it for?

What better way to learn challenging programming concepts than to program it hands on! As a self-learner, this repository is mainly for contributors that want to practice design patterns and Typescript all in one place. For the uninitiated, this might be a good starting point to learning a few patterns through good examples and a well organized library of design patterns.

### Usage

> **All code, discussion, and explanations may or may not be 100% accurate. Should any errors show up, feel free to start an issue.**

1. Every folder is aptly named by its design pattern. Pick your poison.
2. In every pattern, there will be _at least_ 1 working example and a README document with the following sections:
    - Overview of the pattern.
    - A description for each working example, and how the pattern applies.
3. Run `tsc`. This transpiles **all** the Typescript code in the directory to Javascript. Then run `node <file-name>.js` to execute your code.

### Contribute

1. Each pattern will be _developed in its own branch_, named after the name of the pattern. **Feel free to start new patterns!**
2. Approved contributions (new code or otherwise) will be merged after review.
3. Every new working example should go into its own folder.

> We strive to follow **good general coding practices**, **good typescript practices**, and **a good use of GitHub and version controlling**.
