# Design Patterns in Typescript (WIP)

> âœ… 0 / 23

### Usage
1. Every folder is aptly named by its design pattern.
2. In every pattern, there will be at least 1 working example and a README document with the following sections:
   - Overview of the pattern.
   - A description for each working example, and how the pattern applies.
   - Additional internet resources for the reader's further knowledge.

### Contribute
1. While the title still says **(WIP)**, all patterns will be implemented in the order as laid out in the [Head First Design Patterns text](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented/dp/149207800X/ref=asc_df_149207800X/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=459709175715&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4047598088864205723&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9005533&hvtargid=pla-918195320150&psc=1). Expected frequency is one pattern every 2-4 days. Ultimately, the original contributors will decide the pace. 
2. Fork this repository. 
3. Each pattern will be *developed in its own branch*, named after the name of the pattern. Let the original contributors decide when the right time is for a new pattern. 
4. Approved contributions will be merged after review. 
5. Every new working example should go into its own folder.
